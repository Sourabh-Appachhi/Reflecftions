When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    1. When we want to host our code on any server. 
    2. When there are more than 1 collaboraters
    3. When I am using different systems
    4. Also to keep a backup

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    1. To make sure there are no conflicts
    2. To make sure the local changes are not overwritten

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Fork: Its a clone of repository within github accounts. It will be used when we want to make changes to any existing repository with different author and give suggestions to merge to the author. Basically this will be done to public reporsitory
    Clones: This will be local copy of the remote repository. This will be used when more than one user/computer is used to collaborate to a single repository
    Branch: This will be a local copy of a given commit in the local repository. This will be used when we want to continue our work from a specific commit in our repository but without pushing any changes to the origin

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    It will keep us up to date with the remote changes so that we dont miss out on the new changes which happened on different systems/from differnt collaboraters

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    Using pendrives/Google Drive. We can work in offline mode also using drives. The harder part would be to keep track of the changes and if we need to collaborate from differnt locations

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
